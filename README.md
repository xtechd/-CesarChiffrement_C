# CaesarChiffrement_C

The Caesar Chiffrement project is a simple encryption exercise created in C for training purposes. 
It implements the Caesar Cipher encryption technique, shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions.

For example : 

Using the Caesar Cipher with a shift of 3:

-Plaintext: "hello"
-Encrypted text: "khoor"

Each letter in the plaintext is shifted three positions to the right in the alphabet to generate the ciphertext.
